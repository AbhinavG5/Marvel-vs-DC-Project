# Marvel vs DC - Data Analytics Project
I created an Marvel vs. DC analytics project using SQL and Power BI to analyze and visualize data. By leveraging SQL's data querying capabilities, I organized and analyzed relevant data on Marvel and DC properties. With Power BI's visualization features, 

I created dynamic and visually appealing dashboards and reports that offer insights into Box Office Performance, IMDb and Rotten Tomatos Rating, and Market Share. 

This project provides companies with valuable insights to optimize their marketing strategies, licensing agreements, and product development efforts in the comic book industry and movie franchise. By harnessing data-driven insights, businesses can adapt to market dynamics and gain a competitive edge.
